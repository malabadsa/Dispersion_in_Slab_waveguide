# Dispersion_in_Slab_waveguide
In this project, dispersion analysis on slab waveguide has been done for different modes from 1 to 6, the first figure shows the dispersion curve, where it can be seen that the propagation constant shows better performance for the fundamental mode m = 0.

Then the TE mode curves are shown, for the fundamental mode m = 0, it can be seen that there is just one peak over the core size, when m = 2 there are two peaks and so on, it is noticed that the electric field distribution modes expand over the thickness of the core when the core size increases, the change of the core size effects the intensity of the electric field.
